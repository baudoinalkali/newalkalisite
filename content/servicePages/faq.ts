            question: "Should I choose a custom-built WordPress site or a template-based one?",
            answer: "It is common for companies just starting out to use a template-based website due to the lower development costs. While it is less expensive there are many drawbacks such as limited customization, slower performance, and not optimized for SEO. A custom WordPress site ensures that everything is built with one thing in mind, your business or brand. They can be better optimized and completely bespoke to you.",
